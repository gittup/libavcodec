/*
 * VFP is a floating point coprocessor used in some ARM cores. VFP11 has 1 cycle
 * throughput for almost all the instructions (except for double precision
 * arithmetics), but rather high latency. Latency is 4 cycles for loads and 8 cycles
 * for arithmetic operations. Scheduling code to avoid pipeline stalls is very
 * important for performance. One more interesting feature is that VFP has
 * independent load/store and arithmetics pipelines, so it is possible to make
 * them work simultaneously and get more than 1 operation per cycle. Load/store
 * pipeline can process 2 single precision floating point values per cycle and
 * supports bulk loads and stores for large sets of registers. Arithmetic operations
 * can be done on vectors, which allows to keep the arithmetics pipeline busy,
 * while the processor may issue and execute other instructions. Detailed
 * optimization manuals can be found at http://www.arm.com
