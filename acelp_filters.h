/**
 * low-pass FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter coefficients
 *
 *   A similar filter is named b30 in G.729.
 *
 *   G.729 specification says:
 *     b30 is based on Hamming windowed sinc functions, truncated at +/-29 and
 *     padded with zeros at +/-30 b30[30]=0.
 *     The filter has a cut-off frequency (-3 dB) at 3600 Hz in the oversampled
 *     domain.
 *
 *   After some analysis, I found this approximation:
 *
 *                                    PI * x
 *   Hamm(x,N) = 0.53836-0.46164*cos(--------)
 *                                      N-1
 *                                      ---
 *                                       2
 *
 *                                                             PI * x
 *   Hamm'(x,k) = Hamm(x - k, 2*k+1) =  0.53836 + 0.46164*cos(--------)
 *                                                                k
 *
 *             sin(PI * x)
 *   Sinc(x) = ----------- (normalized sinc function)
 *               PI * x
 *
 *   h(t,B) = 2 * B * Sinc(2 * B * t) (impulse response of sinc low-pass filter)
 *
 *   b(k,B, n) = Hamm'(n, k) * h(n, B)
 *
 *
 *       3600
 *   B = ----
 *       8000
 *
 *   3600 - cut-off frequency
 *   8000 - sampling rate
 *   k    - filter order
 *
 *   ff_acelp_interp_filter[6*i+j] = b(10, 3600/8000, i+j/6)
 *
 * The filter assumes the following order of fractions (X - integer delay):
 *
 * 1/3 precision: X     1/3      2/3      X     1/3      2/3      X
 * 1/6 precision: X 1/6 2/6 3/6  4/6  5/6 X 1/6 2/6 3/6  4/6  5/6 X
 *
 * The filter can be used for 1/3 precision, too, by
 * passing 2*pitch_delay_frac as third parameter to the interpolation routine.
